        <h1>Benefits Of Vegetable Salad</h1>
        <p>Aside from their natural good taste and great crunchy texture alongside wonderful colors and fragrances, eating a large serving of fresh, raw vegetables each day can have significant health benefits.</p>
        <h1>Steps to make Vegetable Salad</h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li> &#8226; Take a large and clear glass bowl</li>
            <li> &#8226;Try adding blanched, lightly steamed or roasted veggies like broccoli, french beans, corn, cauliflower, baby corn.</li>
            <li> &#8226;Add lentils, beans or chickpeas or bean sprouts for more protein.</li>
            <li> &#8226;Grate some of the vegetables for a different texture.</li>
            <li> &#8226;Add marinated veggies like artichoke hearts for tang, or other veggies like radish for some pungency.</li>
            <li> &#8226;Swap in your own favorite combination of dried fruits, nuts and seeds. I added what I had at home.</li>
            <li> &#8226;Use fresh coriander or chives instead of parsley.</li>
        </ul>
